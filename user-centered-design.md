# User-Centered Design - Travis Lowdermilk

## Chapter 1 - Our World Has Change

- Users are going to expect more
- We need to include users in the process of building products 
- Create a focused and efficient development process

## Chapter 2 - What is User-Centered Design?

- The world of usability is broad and focuses on the study of humans interacting with any product
- Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a subset of usability that focuses specifically on humans interacting with computing products
- User-centered design (UCD) is a methodology used by developers and designers to ensure they’re creating products that meet users’ needs
- User experience (UX) is one of the many focuses of UCD. It includes the user’s entire experience with the product, including physical and emotional reactions

- UCD is not usability
- UCD is not subjective
- UCD is not just design
- UCD is not a waste of time or money
	- Time spent with users are a necessary part of the development process
	- UCD can actually save you time by eliminating misunderstandings and costly mistakes
- UCD is not a bug report
- UCD is not a distraction
	- It ensures that we focus on the right things

## Chapter 3 - Working with Users

- Although working with users can be difficult, they’re invaluable assets in creating a successful software application.
- Users aren’t always right. Oftentimes, they’re terrible at describing or understanding what they need. It’s our job to continually ask questions and get to the root of what they’re asking for.
- Bring users into your development process and educate them on using the right terminology. Give them the tools to better explain their needs.
- Users have their own way of approaching problems. Learn how to work with different personalities so you can get the most from your users.
- Work hard to remove negative language and attitudes. Avoid the Fundamental Attribution Error, which is “the inclination to explain people’s behavior by the way they are rather than the situation they are in.”

## Chapter 4 - Having a plan

- Your team should have a mission statement that reflects your purpose and commitment to users and each other.
	- Team mission statement should be different from organization's mission statement.
- Consider creating a project template that starts with planning, moves to implementation and testing, and ends with deployment and maintenance.
- You should include a project details section in your template. The project details should include the title of the project, a description of what it is, and an impact assessment, if appropriate.
- Your documented plan should include a list of user requirements. Essentially, this list represents your users’ needs and should not include technological solutions.
	- Show users their requests in writing and get them to verify as well.
- Functional requirements are a list of your application’s needs. This list is focused on the technology and how it will meet each user requirement.
- If your application is reliant on a dataset or complex user workflow be sure to include database and/or dataflow diagrams in your documentation.
- Prototypes can be a powerful tool in the user-centered design process. Be sure to document any screenshots or early mockups of your prototype.
- Reviewing old documentation can be a valuable exercise in learning from previous mistakes.

Example template:
- Team mission statement
- Project details
	- Title
	- Description
	- List of stakeholders
	- Impact assessment
- User requirements
- Functional requirements
- Database/dataflow diagrams
- Screenshots of prototypes

## Chapter 5 - Creating a Personal Manifesto

- Consider having a manifesto or vision statement for your application. A manifesto is the overall purpose and vision for your application.
- By building a narrative, you take the declarative statement of your manifesto and weave a rich story of how your application can be used.
- Personas are fictional, character-driven elements that personify your ideal user. Use personas to enhance your narrative and help tell the story of your application.
- Scenarios, just like scenes in a movie, are specific situations your personas might find themselves in. Using scenarios, you can explore how the application will respond (or not respond) to the user’s needs.
	- If possible, let users review your personas and scenarios and allow them to give you feedback

Details for crafting a persona:
- Name
- Age
- Marital and family status
- Location
- Occupation
- Hobbies and favorite items
- Needs and frustrations

## Chapter 6 - Creativity and User Experience

- Make sure to include user experience goals in your user-centered design process. Your users expect more than basic functionality: they expect applications that are delightful and thoughtfully considered.
	- How important is load time? Will they be willing to wait for things to load if it means we can provide a richer experience?
	- How will users be interacting with the application? Touch, voice, gestures, keyboard, mouse? Will the type of input affect the way I present information to them?
	- Should the application be fun to use? Do I want users to be amused and surprised or do they expect something consistent?
	- What tone of language should I use to communicate with the user? Is it whimsical, professional, supportive, or energetic? Is the language I’ve chosen consistent throughout the application?
- Creativity requires us to be courageous and vulnerable. Although trying new things may be risky and embarrassing, it’s the key to discovering new insights.
- Drawing and sketching can have a positive impact on your creativity. Also, consider encouraging your users to draw. This may help them communicate their ideas.
- Freedom from constraints is essential to encouraging creativity. Take a break from whatever you’re currently working on and consider spending time exploring new projects, technologies, or interests.
- Fully understanding your goal or vision will help you remain focused and creative.
- If you’re having trouble coming up with your own ideas, don’t be afraid to observe others’ work and incorporate it.
- Creativity requires you to constantly ask questions.

## Chapter 7 - Design Principles

- It’s important to learn and study design principles. There are many, and by simply following their guidance, you can dramatically improve the experience of your applications.
- The principle of proximity (Gestalt Principle) states that humans perceive a relationship between objects that are closer together. Use this principle by grouping functions together. This will make it easier to learn and understand your application.
- The visibility principle states that visual cues should be present to assist users in understanding the status of the application.
- The visual prominence principle states that a user’s attention is drawn to objects that are larger, brighter, or more prominent.
- The principle of visual feedback states that an application should respond to the user by signifying that an input has been received. Applications should also indicate to the user when they are processing a request.
- Mental models and metaphors are how humans transfer real-world knowledge to the computing world. Be sure that your iconography, language, and other metaphors are rooted in knowledge users understand.
- Progressive disclosure removes and disables features that are not applicable to the user’s current state.
- The consistency principle states that tasks within an application should function as expected. You shouldn’t invent new workflows for completing tasks that are already understood by the user.
- Affordance helps users do the right thing, and constraints prevent them from doing the wrong thing.
- The confirmation principle states that applications should require verification to prevent users from performing undesired actions. The save confirmation dialog is a good example.
- Hick’s Law is a prescriptive model that’s used to determine the time it takes to select an item based on the number of items available to choose from. The more items you include in a menu, the longer the response time is for the user.
- Fitt’s Law is another prescriptive model that’s used to determine the time it takes a user to move the cursor from one location to the target location. The further a user must travel with their cursor, the less accuracy the user will have in reaching the target object.

Ways to bring visual focus:
- Typeface
	- Different styles and sizes of text can draw a user’s attention.
- Opacity
	- Adjusting an item’s opaqueness helps reduce or enhance its visibility.
- Prominence
	- Those elements that are larger than others will bring them greater visibility, as demonstrated in Figure 7-3.
- Status
	- Indicates that the application is processing a request or has received input from the user.
- Color/Contrast
	- Traditionally, items with higher contrast or brighter colors will draw more attention.
- Hierarchy

## Chapter 8 - Gathering Feedback

- There’s no magic number for how many study participants you should have. Although some disagree, Jakob Nielsen, a leading usability expert, suggests no more than five.
- Surveys can help you quickly collect feedback from many users. Surveys are relatively easy to distribute but often provide broad results.
- The Likert scale is a format of questions and answers used on surveys. The responses help subjects communicate value for things like frequency, importance, and satisfaction.
- One challenge with the Likert scale is acquiescence bias, which is the tendency for respondents to be agreeable or answer questions in a way they believe the surveyor would prefer.
- Conducting interviews requires more time, but is a great way to get direct user feedback. There are three types of interviews: unstructured (informal), structured (formal), and contextual (contextual inquiry).
	- Unstructured interviews encourage conversation. They tend to be open-ended, without a specific agenda in mind. These types of interviews are used when you’re beginning to explore the problem space.
	- Structured interviews focus on consistency. It’s recommended that you use a script and ask respondents questions in the same tone, order, and language.
	- Contextual inquiries are much like interviews except that they focus on visiting and talking with users in their environment. By exploring the environment, you may uncover factors that affect your application, such as noise, lighting, distractions, etc.
- Task analysis is the thorough examination of a task or process. It’s ideal that you actually observe the user completing the task; however, it’s not required.
- Heuristic evaluation is the process of reviewing your application against industry standards and principles. Many software companies provide usability guidelines and will often block applications from their marketplace if these standards aren’t met.
- Storyboards are a way to sketch the user experience step by step. Storyboards should give you an overall impression of how your application will flow.
- Prototypes can be a powerful tool in allowing users to visualize what you intend to build for them. Give your users choices and allow them to make decisions on larger aspects of your application.
- A/B testing is the process of presenting two interfaces to users and choosing the winning design based on the interface that provides the desired action. Decisions are made completely on data.

Fundamental questions to answer when working on an application:
- What problem does your application solve? What’s its core focus?
- Who are the ideal users for your application? What are they like? Are they advanced users or novices?
- What are your three must-have features? How do you know they are the most important?
- How will your application provide value? How will it improve on what people are currently using?

## Chapter 9 - Usability Studies

- A usability study is the process of testing your application’s design by observing users, measuring their performance, and documenting their comments.
- Just like in the entire user-centered design process, make sure your usability study is thoughtfully planned. You’ll want to know what tasks you’re testing and how you plan to measure them.
- Prepare a written script. This will ensure that the way you interact with each subject is consistent and on track.
- While users complete the task, encourage them to think aloud. This will help you understand their thought process and enable you to pick up on things your application might’ve missed.
- You’ll want to be prepared with a stopwatch, notepad, acceptable location, and a collection of subjects who best represent your target users.
- When conducting the study, sit behind the user so you won’t distract her with your note taking. After each task, consider giving out a questionnaire so you can finish last-minute documentation and prepare for the next task.
- Practicing is a great way to make sure you’ve prepared a study that will give you the best results.
- After you’ve received study results, calculate your measurements and organize your comments. The data will help justify your design decisions.

## Chapter 10 - You're Never Finished

- It's impossible to get it right the first time
- Be prepared to reboot
- Final thoughts
	- UCD requires soft skills
	- Users should know they're at the center of your application's focus, then they'll reward it with their preference and loyalty
 
If our application doesn't meet users' needs, we need to ask basic questions:
- What are we trying to achieve?
- How are we providing value?
- What do our users love?
- What do our users hate?
