# Talking with Tech Leads
by Patrick Kua

## 1. People

### Remaining Technically Grounded
A Tech Lead must be technically competent, since this helps build respect and rapport with people, however the Tech Lead does not necessarily need to be the best technically and, in many cases, does not necessarily have the deepest technical skills on the team.

### Finding and Developing Good People

Tech Leads are naturally part of the interview process, looking for cultural fit, aptitude, and a positive attitude to learning.

In addition to finding good people, the effective Tech Lead focuses equally on growing developers in their team. A common practice is to meet one-on-one with each developer to find out what their interests are, what motivates them and what they consider their strengths to be. With this information, the Tech Lead constantly seeks ways to match interests and opportunities across the team.

A Tech Lead grows developers by encouraging them to step outside of “just programming” and work closely with other people in the software development process. 

### Listening to the Team

The Tech Lead finds opportunities to listen to the people on their team.

“Does everyone feel comfortable expressing their opinion?” Tech Leads need to establish safety.

Once you create safety you must then cultivate motivation for full team effectiveness. Different things motivate different people and it takes time to find out what each person wants to do and find opportunities to do them. Listening is the key to this.

Tech Leads spend less time in code, so they rely more heavily on information from the team. You draw upon good questioning skills to draw out the information you need to make better decisions.

### Appreciating Individual Strengths

A Tech Lead appreciates the different strengths that each person brings to the team. Over time you will recognise these different strengths. 

Differences in strengths bring opportunities for learning and better problem solving but they also create an opportunity for conflict. The Tech Lead pays attention to heated discussions in the team and helps the team move forward when too much conflict threatens to permanently damage team relationships. Tech Leads should not be afraid to facilitate technical discussions (particularly heated ones!) in order to move forward. Very rarely will a Tech Lead step in to override a decision as this disempowers team members and generates resentment.

## 2. The Tech of a Tech Lead

### Guiding the Technical Solution

The first distinguishing responsibility of a Tech Lead is their governance of a technical solution. This responsibility overlaps with a Technical Architect and in many organisations these two roles are one and the same.

The Tech Lead shapes the overall technical solution to ensure that all requirements are met. They need to appreciate all the functional requirements to understand what might be built as well as cross-functional requirements (CFRs) about how it might be delivered.

### Harmonising Team Direction

When you have a group of developers working on a single system, you will have occasions when developers disagree about how to approach a problem. Disagreements are healthy as long as the team settles on a direction relatively quickly. Disagreements become destructive when the team divides, unable to choose between alternatives.

Tech Leads watch carefully when the team reaches an impasse. They use different strategies to find ways for the team to move forward, perhaps facilitating, reaching for external advice, or sometimes stepping in to make a decision. 

A Tech Lead also looks for signs that indicate developers may be moving in different directions. A team in harmony looks similar to a single developer writing the codebase.

A Tech Lead promotes design principles and architectural guidelines for developers to make decisions that align with the overall technical solution.

### Managing Technical Risks

Technical risks quickly turn into issues that affect everyone who wants to change software, not just the developers. 

The Tech Lead works with developers to identify, prioritise and find ways to mitigate technical risks. The Tech Lead makes risks more visible to outside stakeholders and lobbies for time and resources to address them.

The Tech Lead finds different approaches to express technical risks to non-technical people. The Tech Lead uses metaphors and visualisations to explain to non-technical people the impact that taking risks might have. Expressing technical issues in ways non-technical people can understand creates better rapport and generates support for fixing them.

### Taking a Longer-Term View

The Tech Lead has to approach problems with a wider perspective; they look at the consequences that a choice has on other people on the team, and the future work or rework that the choice could save or create. The Tech Lead evaluates decisions with a broader, longer-term view.

A Tech Lead becomes particularly concerned if a choice today makes it more difficult to change or add to the system tomorrow. The Tech Lead finds opportunities to safely expose a developer to this broader view to grow the developer’s awareness of the impact an individual decision might have on the future.

## 3. Bridging Business with Tech

### Building Trust

As a Tech Lead, you spend more time with non-technical stakeholders and this is a good opportunity to build trust. The Tech Lead must constantly manage the perception that too much time is being spent on activities that may not have any obvious visible return on investment. 


### Finding Time for Technology

A Tech Lead manages technical risk and champions the need for time invested in quality, but this can only be done with trust from other parties. 

Fortunately, spending time on quality issues has a direct positive impact on end-users or the business, by making the user experience better and faster, for example, or resulting in fewer requests for help and assistance.

The Tech Lead is ultimately accountable and must monitor where and when to take each approach based on value being delivered.

### Making Technology Solutions Easy to Understand

A Tech Lead has to develop the essential skill of helping non-technical people understand and relate to the technical issues when necessary. They draw upon the communication tools of simple diagrams, collaborative whiteboard sessions, metaphors and simple, clear language with minimal (or better yet, non-existent) use of acronyms and technical terms. 

The Tech Lead is constantly aware that not all problems can, or should be solved by technical solutions. The Tech Lead builds trust with non-technical people. 

They also work to pass on the necessary communication skills to other members of the technical team so the business does not rely on a single person. 

### Influencing Planning

Organisations look to the Tech Lead for input during budgeting and planning cycles. Zero involvement from the team often leads to over-commitment and technical risks being overlooked. A strong relationship built on trust creates opportunity for the Tech Lead to influence the planning process.

The Tech Lead is careful not to over-commit, as they are aware they do not know everything; committing the team without its involvement creates future tension if the plan goes wrong.

Under promise and over deliver - Tom Peters, from “In Search of Excellence”

Involvement in the planning process gives the Tech Lead greater insight into upcoming areas. Knowledge about plans for the future makes for better decision-making, particularly when arbitrating between what-if scenarios in the codebase.

### Championing Business Needs

As you spend more time closer to the business, the Tech Lead appreciates what is truly important to the business. The Tech Lead uses this knowledge to make the team more aware of their operating context. The Tech Lead clarifies the current goal and reminds the team how their software moves the business towards the goal.

A clearer understanding of the real goal helps developers make better choices. 

## 4. You

### Adapting to New Circumstances

When a developer encounters a new problem, or a new library or programming language, they must draw upon new skills. Likewise, the Tech Lead must draw upon different skills to handle different situations. 

A Tech Lead has to handle many more varied situations than they did as a developer, often with little practice in new skills. You need to develop a broader skill set to better cope with these new situations. Attend training courses or read books that improve your communication skills and awareness of people and team behaviours.

### Making Yourself Redundant

An effective Tech Lead must be technical enough to facilitate meetings with developers, or find ways to resolve disagreements on technical matters. However many Tech Leads wrote about trying to constantly find ways to delegate responsibilities to their team.

Effective delegation means assigning the right person to the task. This requires trust between the Tech Lead and their developers and understanding what skills and knowledge each person has. 

If you are the Tech Lead and the most technically competent person, you should start growing others so you can delegate decisions in the future. 

### Using Your Own Strengths

Spend time understanding yourself. Then spend time finding ways to apply those strengths to the role of Tech Lead to make it your own.

## Summary

### LESSONS LEARNED BY FIRST-TIME TECH LEADS

#### Having a broader outlook

Moving beyond the thoughts of a single feature, or code and seeing the whole breadth of the team and business.

#### Sensing greater responsibility

The authority that comes with the title requires greater accountability; you are accountable not only for your decisions, but the decisions and actions of each person on the team.

#### Guiding the technical vision

The combination of more responsibility and a broader outlook gives rise to concerns when individuals move in different directions. You spend more time providing direction from a technical point of view.

#### Coping with less time writing code

You have to redefine how you bring value to the team. You have to look at how you enable others to contribute quality code that requires little rework and delivers to business needs rather than the amount of code or features you deliver.

#### Juggling more context switches

The Tech Lead role challenges your time and task-management capabilities as more people will interrupt you for clarification, guidance, and advice. Burning issues draw you away from code-writing, so you need to beware of contributing to the critical path or holding unique knowledge from the team.

#### Allowing people to fail

You cannot be everywhere at once and, as much as you want to tell people the traps to avoid, you have to accept that sometimes people learn best by failing. Instead you ensure failure has a small impact by improving the speed of feedback loops.

#### Realising people aspects are hard

As a developer, you deal with computers for most of the time. You can act grumpily and the computer doesn’t react. You realise that everyone is unique and so reacts differently to your interactions. Suddenly you are responsible for resolving conflicts when, before, you could silently slip away.


### LESSONS LEARNED BY PRACTISING TECH LEADS

### People

#### Remaining technically grounded

Other developers respect you more if you still write code with the team. Your understanding of the issues also improves if you have contact with the code.
#### Finding and developing good people

As a Tech Lead you are responsible for hiring a great team. You cannot rely on hiring people in an ever-changing market and so you need to develop the people in your team and create an environment that encourages learning.
#### Listening to the team

As a developer, you probably spend most of your time giving opinions. Your Tech Lead role requires you to now listen to all the opinions and find the best solution within this cacophony.
#### Appreciating individual strengths

You will appreciate and sometimes be frustrated by the way people behave differently. You start to recognise different strengths and find ways and situations where people’s these are best applied.

### The “Tech” of a Tech Lead
#### Guiding the technical solution

A Tech Lead is responsible for everyone sharing the same technical vision. You use architecture diagrams and whiteboard sessions to help build a shared understanding within the team to help align people.

#### Harmonising team direction

Nothing is more destructive in a development team than conflict that resolves itself through the source control system, with different opinions expressed through snide commit messages, or by overwriting someone else’s style. A Tech Lead detects conflicts and differences in direction and facilitates the team to get back on track.

#### Managing technical risks

Software has so many potential traps and someone must ensure they don’t get forgotten. Your role as a Tech Lead is to find ways to create visibility and shared understanding of technical risks and to find ways as a group to address them.

#### Taking a longer-term view

Developers are more likely to focus on a very narrow view of their feature or contribution. Tech Leads worry more about how the choices of today will turn into the problem areas of tomorrow.

### Bridging the Business with Tech

#### Building trust

As a developer, you spend most of your time in the details, interacting with people from other parts of the business just enough to work out what you need to build the right feature. As you move into the Tech Lead role, you spend more time building relationships with key business stakeholders; becoming the “go-to” person from the technical team.

#### Finding time for technology

Bowing to the pressures from the business to add more features is easy. Ensuring that it is done in a sustainable way is one key challenge that the Tech Lead balances. Having a strong trust with the business makes this possible and translating the benefits of investing in technology helps build better understanding.

#### Making technology solutions easy to understand

Software is complex in many ways, filled with terminology, constantly changing brands and ideas. As an experienced Tech Lead, you know how to simplify the technical solution and can find analogies or stories to help non-technical people understand the technical landscape enough to help them make better decisions.

#### Influencing planning

When you have built strong trust and skill in simplifying technical ideas, you will inevitably be drawn into more future-focused sessions that might involve budgeting or project planning, because people see yours as an important component. You balance this carefully because more time away from the team reduces the freshness of your own information.

#### Championing business needs

Sometimes technology teams drift away from understanding end users and the business models that serve them. Tech Leads bring that bigger picture back to the team, and clarify how technical solutions impact end users, and what the business goals are. With this knowledge, the team can make better trade-offs in solution-fidelity once they understand what and how a solution will be used.
You

#### Adapting to new circumstances

From the responses in this book, you can see how many diverse situations Tech Lead may find themselves in and the richness of skills needed to deal with them. You must find ways to build skills you may never have had a chance to develop before.

#### Making yourself redundant

Although you may find it easy to play the “Hero Tech Lead” who does everything on their own, it is not sustainable over the long term, nor does it scale to a bigger team. You focus on developing people and finding ways to delegate tasks so that you can spend more time “just being a developer”.

#### Using your own strengths

Everyone has their own approach to being a Tech Lead, and when thrust into this role, you spend more time introspecting about what you can offer and apply it generously.
